# About

Qt is a cross-platfrom application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface, and also used for developing non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for servers.

Qt5 was officially released on 19 December 2012. Qt5 brings significant improvements to the speed and ease of developing user interfaces.

In this project, we try to translate some documents of Qt5 into Chinese in the hope of helping some beginners in China.
